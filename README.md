## Inspiration 💡

EventFlux was born from the inspiration I found in the [`flutter_client_sse` package](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_client_sse) by [Pratik Baid](https://github.com/pratikbaid3). His work laid a great foundation, and I aimed to build upon it, adding my own twist to enhance SSE stream management with better features. 🛠️

## Why EventFlux? 🌟

- **Streamlined Connection Handling**: Easy setup for connecting to event streams with support for both GET and POST requests. 🔌
- **Auto-Reconnect Capability**: Seamlessly maintains your connection, automatically reconnecting in case of any server interruptions or network changes. Devs can choose to do linear or exponential backoff  🔄
- **Real-Time Data Management**: Efficient processing and handling of real-time data streams. 📈
- **Error Handling**: Robust mechanisms to manage connection interruptions and stream errors. 🛡️
- **Versatile Instance Creation**: Offers both singleton and factory patterns for tailored SSE connections. 🌍
- **Customizable**: Extendable to fit various use cases and custom implementations. ✨


## EventFlux for Every Scenario 🌟

## Get Started in a Snap 📦

Add EventFlux to your Dart project's dependencies, and you're golden:

```yaml
dependencies:
  eventflux: ^2.0.1
```


## How to Use (Spoiler: It's Super Easy) 🔧

Here's a quick example to get you started:

<details>
<summary>The Simple Streamer ✨</summary>
&nbsp;<br>
Need just one SSE connection? It's a breeze with EventFlux! Perfect for when your app is dancing solo with a single SSE.


```dart
import 'package:eventflux/eventflux.dart';

void main() {
  // Connect and start the magic!
   EventFlux.instance.connect(
     EventFluxConnectionType.get,
     'https://example.com/events',
     onSuccessCallback: (EventFluxResponse? response) {
      response.stream?.listen((data) {
        // Your data is now in the spotlight!
      });
     },
     onError: (oops) {
      // Oops! Time to handle those little hiccups.
      // You can also choose to disconnect here
    },
    autoReconnect: true // Keep the party going, automatically!
    reconnectConfig: ReconnectConfig(
        mode = ReconnectMode.linear, // or exponential,
        interval = Duration(seconds: 5),
        maxAttempts = 5 // or -1 for infinite,
        onReconnect = () {
          // Things to execute when reconnect happens
          // FYI: for network changes, the `onReconnect` will not be called. 
          // It will only be called when the connection is interupted by the server and eventflux is trying to reconnect.
        }
    ),
   );
}

```

When your app just need a multiple parallel SSE connections, use this.

```dart
import 'package:eventflux/eventflux.dart';

void main() {

  // Create separate EventFlux instances for each SSE connection
  EventFlux e1 = EventFlux.spawn();
  EventFlux e2 = EventFlux.spawn();

   // First connection - firing up!
  e1.connect(EventFluxConnectionType.get, 
     'https://example1.com/events',
     onSuccessCallback: (EventFluxResponse? data) {
       data.stream?.listen((data) {
        // Your 1st Stream's data is being fetched!
      });
     },
     onError: (oops) {
        // Oops! Time to handle those little hiccups.
        // You can also choose to disconnect here
      },
  );

   // Second connection - firing up!
   e2.connect(EventFluxConnectionType.get,
     'https://example2.com/events',
     onSuccessCallback: (EventFluxResponse? data) {
       data.stream?.listen((data) {
        // Your 2nd Stream's data is also being fetched!
      });
     },
     onError: (oops) {
        // Oops! Time to handle those little hiccups.
        // You can also choose to disconnect here
      },
    autoReconnect: true // Keep the party going, automatically!
    reconnectConfig: ReconnectConfig(
        mode = ReconnectMode.exponential, // or linear,
        interval = Duration(seconds: 5),
        maxAttempts = 5 // or -1 for infinite,
        onReconnect = () {
          // Things to execute when reconnect happens
          // FYI: for network changes, the `onReconnect` will not be called. 
          // It will only be called when the connection is interupted by the server and eventflux is trying to re-establish the connection.
        }
    ),
  );
}

```

ℹ️ Remember to disconnect all instances when you are done with it to avoid memory leaks.

### EventFlux Class Documentation 📖

`EventFlux` is a Dart class for managing server-sent event streams. It provides methods for connecting to, disconnecting from, and managing SSE streams.
